# Tt Travels Font Free Download
  
Type designer Chank Diesel has just released his typographic autobiography, Travelling Font Salesman. A unique approach to showing types he has produced over the past few years, this book was launched through Kickstarter, and displays about 20 fonts. I asked Diesel to talk about the whys and wherefores of this effort.

TT Travels Text is a geometric sans serif with wide proportions. When creating this font, our goal was to maintain the central idea and recognizable features of the familiar TT Travels, making it cleaner and more modern. As a result, we have an independent typeface that perfectly complements TT Travels Next as a pair and equally excels in solo work.
 
The new TT Travels Text boasts numerous helpful OpenType features. Stylistic sets include softer, more neutral forms. The expanded ligature sets graphic is now calm and smooth, supporting the overall mood of the typeface. The typeface also includes a variable font with two axes of variation to enhance its application range even more.
 
I understand that I am allowed to use fonts licensed under the Open Font License in PDFs. However, I want to do it in a way that complies with the OFL and some things remain pretty unclear to me. Even if I never had any intention to redistribute fonts through a PDF, as the OFL FAQ 1.15 states:
 
When I open a PDF in Acrobat Reader I can find which fonts are present inside it. And it is pretty clear in the abovementioned FAQ that it is legally a technical matter, not one of intention. Which leads me to three questions :
 
Fonts embedded in PDFs are transformed in such a way that extraction and use of the font outside that PDF is technically difficult and clearly not intended. That is part of the PDF format and is true whatever tools are used. Searchable text does not change the way fonts are embedded. Adding the copyright and license to the PDF is not required.
 
1.15 What about distributing fonts with a document? Within a compressed folder structure? Is it distribution, bundling or embedding?
Certain document formats may allow the inclusion of an unmodified font within their file structure which may consist of a compressed folder containing the various resources forming the document (such as pictures and thumbnails). Including fonts within such a structure is understood as being different from embedding but rather similar to bundling (or mere aggregation) which the license explicitly allows. In this case the font is conveyed unchanged whereas embedding a font usually transforms it from the original format. The OFL does not allow anyone to extract the font from such a structure to then redistribute it under another license. The explicit permission to redistribute and embed does not cancel the requirement for the Font Software to remain under the license chosen by its author(s). Even if the font travels inside the document as one of its assets, it should not lose its authorship information and licensing.
 
An Electronic Doc license is based on the number of publications in which the font is used. Each issue counts as a separate publication. Regional or format variations don't count as separate publications.
 
We'll supply a kit containing webfonts that can be used within digital ads, such as banner ads. This kit may be shared with third parties who are working on your behalf to produce the ad creatives, however you are wholly responsible for it.
 
Digital advertisements also have different usage patterns compared to websites. Most websites generally have consistent pageviews month-to-month whereas advertising impressions can vary wildly month-to-month. Prices reflect this, making it much less expensive to use a Digital Ad license.
 
If you know the number of impressions the campaign requires, that amount can be ordered before the campaign begins. For campaigns where number impressions is unknown until the end of the campaign, you can true up at the end of each calendar month.
 
Webfonts allow you to embed the font into a webpage using the @font-face rule, so paragraphs and headings of text can be styled as the webfont. You will be serving the webfont kit for your own site and linking it in the CSS.
 
Webfonts can be used on a single domain. Agencies responsible for multiple websites, for example web design agencies or hosting providers, may not share a single webfont license across multiple websites.
 
The key visual features of TT Travels Text are wide proportions and slightly squared forms of ovals. To make the typeface readable, we increased the height of lowercase letters and opened the aperture more compared to the original TT Travels. We also worked on the proportions and contours, slimmed down the oval shapes, and reworked the master weights to harmonize the text version and TT Travels Next as a pair. In addition, we removed ink traps in the bold font style, making the font's appearance more neutral and modern.
 
I have been faithfully attempting to get tickets to Font de Gaume, checking every week. Up until this week there were tickets available for a month or so in advance. I have been waiting on getting tickets for June. Today on the website I was checking again and it appears that all dates are blacked out for the rest of the year? At least I am not able to click on a date, not sure what is going on. Has anyone had success recently booking this?   
And any recommendations for other caves that I should try to book in advance in the Dordogne region?  
Thank you
 
the font du gaume changes its procedures constantly. The last few times we have been in the area they had 60 tickets a day and they went to the first 60 people who showed up. People arrive VERY early although the office opens at 9 and sit in marked seats 1-60 until the office opens. Every person has to be there; one person can't come and hog seats for late arrivals. I suspect they shift to this in summer.
 
Karen, Don't panic! It's OK. I, too, have been monitoring the French national monuments website for Font de Gaume tickets for a May visit to France. For some time, the English language version of the Font de Gaume website has functioned erratically: sometimes not offering tickets at all, now showing blanked out calendars. Choose French language, and as of today (March 26, 2022) tickets are available up through May 15. When you click through to select time slots, it shows which tours are in English, which in French. If you need help using the French language site, another recent post described what to do step-by-step (but it is pretty self-explanatory, especially if you've been booking museum tickets, train tickets, etc. on French sites).
 
We also booked a day-long cave tour with Ophorus, leaving from Sarlat. The itinerary includes a visit to the national museum of prehistory in Les Eyzies, a visit to the reproduction Lascaux IV, and a visit to Rouffignac Cave, with a lunch stop in a local village. Handy for us since we won't have car.
 
For your reading list, I recommend "Stepping Stones: A Journey Through the Ice Age Caves of the Dordogne" by Christine Desdemaines-Hugon (who also does local cave guiding). The book can get bogged down in detail a bit, but has entire chapters on Font de Gaume, Combarelles, Rouffignac, Cap Blanc, and a lesser-known cave, Bernifal. There is also an appendix listing sites to visit, although it may be out of date because the book was published in 2010.
 
Thanks to you both.   
 Rick, I guess earlier today I went into The Cave of Font de Gaume instead of La Grotte de Font de Gaume. And yes, only the French site works well. But just to clarify....I do want the one that says La Grotte de Font de Gaume, correct??
 
I expect that tickets for my preferred date near the end of May will go on sale in a couple of weeks. If I remember, I will post a description of my success or failure. BTW, my wife reports that the strange English language site behaves differently on an iPad than it does on my Windows PC.
 
Tickets for Font de Gaume just opened up through August 2022 on line. The English language site is still not working properly, not showing tickets available and instead showing all dates blocked out. If you use the French language site like we just did, it works perfectly.
